# Yu-Gi-Oh! Fusion helper
Given a set of card ids, it gets every fusion of the game "Yu-Gi-Oh! Forbidden Memories" (PlayStation 1). It was 
made quickly to win some duels in the game. If you want and have time, you can improve so much thing on this very 
raw script, like put all in CSV files or make a nice GUI. Have fun with retro games! :)
